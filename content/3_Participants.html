<h1>2. Participants</h1>

<p>This section provides a clear and concise overview of who took part in your study, how they were recruited, and why this sample is appropriate for your research questions. Your goal is to provide enough information so that another researcher could understand who your participants were and how your final sample was determined.</p>

<p>You should include the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> How participants were recruited (e.g., SONA, online platforms, social media).</li>
  <li><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong> Any inclusion or exclusion criteria used to screen participants.</li>
  <li><strong>Sample size and exclusions:</strong> Number of participants recruited, number excluded (with reasons), and final sample size.</li>
  <li><strong>Participant groups:</strong> If your study included different groups (e.g., experts vs. novices, experimental vs. control), clearly describe each group and report how many participants were in each.</li>
  <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Key participant characteristics such as age, gender, or other variables relevant to your study, ideally reported for each group.</li>
  <li><strong>Power analysis (if applicable):</strong> Brief explanation of how you determined your sample size.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üí° Example</h3>
<div class="example">
  We recruited two distinct participant groups with varied levels of mathematical expertise. The expert group (<em>n</em> = 75) consisted of individuals with advanced training in mathematics, recruited via the National Registry of Quantitative Specialists (NRQS). To be eligible, experts were required to have completed a postgraduate degree in mathematics or a closely related field. The expert sample was 53% male and 47% female, with a mean age of 29.4 years (<em>SD</em> = 4.2). Experts received a $25 gift voucher for participating.<br><br>
  The novice group (<em>n</em> = 75) comprised undergraduate psychology students recruited via the University of Queensland's SONA system. Eligible students were in their second year or above and had completed no more than one university-level mathematics subject. The novice sample was 68% female and 32% male, with a mean age of 20.3 years (<em>SD</em> = 1.7). Novices received course credit for their participation. Although we initially recruited a total of 162 participants, twelve were excluded prior to analysis (four experts and eight novices) for failing an attention check during the study, resulting in a final sample of 150 participants.<br><br>
  To determine the sample size required for detecting [specific effect size], we conducted a power analysis by [specific procedure]...

<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>
<div class="warning">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Including procedural information:</strong> The Participants section is for describing <em>who</em> took part in your study‚Äînot what they <em>did</em>. Avoid slipping into descriptions of tasks or study flow here. That belongs in the Procedure section.</li>
    <li><strong>Incoherently grouped information:</strong> Don't scatter related information across multiple sentences or paragraphs. Group all sample-related details‚Äîrecruitment, eligibility, exclusions, demographics, and power‚Äîinto a cohesive chunk. This makes it easier for your reader to process and refer back to.</li>

  We recruited 180 first-year undergraduate students through the University of Queensland's SONA participant pool. Participants received course credit for taking part in the study. Given our interest in career decision-making, eligible participants were young adults aged 18‚Äì25 years, for whom career choices are most critical. Twenty-seven participants were excluded from analyses for failing one or more of the three embedded attention checks. The final sample consisted of 153 participants (77.1% female), with ages ranging from 18 to 24 years (M = 18.96, SD = 1.29).
