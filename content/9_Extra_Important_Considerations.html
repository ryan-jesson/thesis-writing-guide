<h1>8. Righting the Writing</h1>

<h2>Balancing Detail and Clarity</h2>

<p>One of the trickiest aspects of writing methods and results is striking the right balance between providing <strong>enough detail</strong> and maintaining <strong>clarity</strong>. A helpful rule of thumb, especially for first drafts, is to <strong>err on the side of including too much detail</strong> rather than too little. This allows your supervisor to easily remove redundant or unnecessary content, whereas missing information is much harder to detect and correct.</p>

<h2>Interactive Practice: Tense and Active Voice</h2>

<p>In the methods section, use past tense consistently. This isn't just a stylistic choice â€” it accurately reflects that the study has already occurred. Moreover, favour an active voice over passive constructions. Instead of writing "Confidence was measured using a 5-point Likert scale," opt for "We measured participants' confidence using a 5-point Likert scale." This approach not only makes your writing more engaging but also clearly attributes actions to the researchers.</p>

<p><strong>Try out the following interactive examples</strong> to practice identifying and revising sentences to use past tense and active voice appropriately:</p>

  <h3>Using Past Tense</h3>

  <div class="correction-block">
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Participants complete a series of spatial reasoning tasks and then answer questions about their strategy use.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleCorrection('tense1')">Make it past tense</button>
    <div id="tense1" class="example-box" style="display:none;">
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> Participants <strong>completed</strong> a series of spatial reasoning tasks and then <strong>answered</strong> questions about their strategy use.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="correction-block">
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The experiment consists of three phases: training, testing, and debriefing. Each phase takes approximately 20 minutes.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleCorrection('tense2')">Make it past tense</button>
    <div id="tense2" class="example-box" style="display:none;">
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> The experiment <strong>consisted</strong> of three phases: training, testing, and debriefing. Each phase <strong>took</strong> approximately 20 minutes.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="correction-block">
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> We randomly assigned participants to conditions, but counterbalancing is used to control for order effects.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleCorrection('tense3')">Make it past tense</button>
    <div id="tense3" class="example-box" style="display:none;">
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> We randomly assigned participants to conditions, but counterbalancing <strong>was used</strong> to control for order effects.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Using Active Voice</h3>

  <div class="correction-block">
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Response times were measured using a digital timer and accuracy was recorded by the experimenter.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleCorrection('voice1')">Convert to active voice</button>
    <div id="voice1" class="example-box" style="display:none;">
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> <strong>We measured</strong> response times using a digital timer and <strong>the experimenter recorded</strong> accuracy.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="correction-block">
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The questionnaires were administered in a randomized order and demographic information was collected at the end of the session.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleCorrection('voice2')">Convert to active voice</button>
    <div id="voice2" class="example-box" style="display:none;">
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> <strong>We administered</strong> the questionnaires in a randomized order and <strong>collected</strong> demographic information at the end of the session.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="correction-block">
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Trials were excluded from analysis if the reaction time was greater than three standard deviations from the mean.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleCorrection('voice3')">Convert to active voice</button>
    <div id="voice3" class="example-box" style="display:none;">
