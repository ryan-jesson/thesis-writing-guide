# Welcome to the Thesis Writing Guide

Welcome! This interactive guide has been developed to support psychology Honours students as you navigate one of the most challenging — and rewarding — academic writing tasks you'll undertake: your thesis.

Writing a thesis isn't just about ticking off section headings. It's about clearly and persuasively communicating *why* your study matters, *how* it was conducted, and *what* your findings contribute. That takes more than just following a template. It takes understanding the purpose behind each section and learning to write with clarity, confidence, and care.

## What This Guide Offers

This guide walks you through the key components of your thesis — the Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion. For each section, you'll find:

- Plain language explanations of what goes where (and why)
- Concrete examples
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Insights on structure, tone, and clarity

The aim is to help you **develop good scientific writing instincts**, not just follow formulas.

## A Living Document

This webpage is a **living document** that will be continuously updated and improved. As I work with more students, gather feedback, and expand this resource, the guide will grow to cover additional sections and writing challenges.

If you're returning to this site later in the year or even next semester, you may find new examples, restructured advice, or extra features that weren't here before. Keep checking back!

## About the Creator

This guide was created in 2025 by **Ryan Jesson**, a cognitive scientist and Honours thesis supervisor in psychology. I built this resource primarily to support my own students, based on years of supervising and reading student theses.

While **other supervisors are more than welcome to use this guide**, please keep in mind that **some advice may not precisely align** with the preferences of every supervisor. Students should always check with their supervisor to confirm what’s most appropriate for your specific project or discipline.
